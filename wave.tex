\section{Configuring ROMS for a Specific Application}
\label{Wave}
This chapter describes the parts of ROMS for which the user is
responsible when configuring it for a given application.  Section
\ref{User} describes the process in a generic fashion while
\S\ref{UpDown} and \S\ref{NEP} step through the application of SCRUM
to upwelling/downwelling and wind-driven Northeast Pacific problems,
respectively.  As distributed, ROMS is ready to run quite a few
examples, where the C preprocessor flags determine which is to be
executed.  Some of these examples are described in Haidvogel and
Beckmann \cite{Haidvogel99}. Some of them are listed here:
\begin{klist}
   \kitem{BIG\_BAD\_BASIN} This is a rectangular, flat-bottomed basin with
 double-gyre wind forcing. When run, it produces a western boundary
 current flowing into a central ``Gulf Stream''
 which goes unstable and generates eddies. The goal is to run
 adiabatically to study the homogenization of potential vorticity.
 It earned its name by taking a long time and causing difficulties
 for the spectral versions of SPEM.
%   \kitem{CANYON\_A} The canyon is a periodic channel with a steep shelf
% along one wall, where the shelf contains a steep canyon.  There is a
% periodic forcing which causes the water to oscillate along the
% channel.  The rotation and the shelf lead to non-zero mean flows,
% especially near the canyon.  Version A is homogeneous and can be
% executed with a 2-D model.  See Haidvogel and Beckmann \cite{HB97} for
% a description of the canyon problems and the gravitational adjustment
% problem.
%   \kitem{CANYON\_B} This is like Canyon A, except that it is
% stratified.
%   \kitem{DAMEE\_B}  DAMEE stands for Data Assimilation and Model
% Evaluation Experiment and is a comparison of different models of
% the North Atlantic.  Version B is a big domain
% extending from 30$^\circ$ S to 65$^\circ$ N.  Additional input files
% are required to run the DAMEE configurations.
   \kitem{GRAV\_ADJ} The gravitational adjustment problem takes place
 in a long narrow domain which is initialized with dense water at one
 end and light water at the other. At time zero, the water is released
 and it generates two propagating fronts as the light water rushes to
 fill the top and the dense water rushes to fill the bottom. This
 configuration was used to test various advection schemes.
   \kitem{OVERFLOW}   This configuration is similar to the
 GRAV\_ADJ problem, but is initialized with dense water in the shallow
part of a domain with a sloping bottom.
   \kitem{SEAMOUNT}   The seamount test was used to test the pressure
 gradient errors.  It has an idealized seamount in a periodic channel.
 See Beckmann and Haidvogel \cite{BH93} and McCalpin \cite{McCalpin94}
 for more information.
   \kitem{UPWELLING}  The upwelling/downwelling example was
 contributed by Anthony Macks and Jason Middleton \cite{Macks93}
 and consists of a periodic channel with shelves on each side.
 There is along-channel wind forcing and the Coriolis term leads
 to upwelling on one side and downwelling on the other side. If
 you run it for several days without vertical mixing, you end up with
 dense water over light water.
\end{klist}
Some input files for the ROMS examples can be found under \code{Data/ROMS}
in the ROMS distribution.

\subsection{Configuring ROMS}
\label{User}

The four main sections you need to change in ROMS are the \code{makefile}
or \code{build.bash}, an include file with \code{cpp} options, any
analytic functions, and the ascii input file. If more realistic fields
are desired, you will have to provide other input files as well, for
instance for the grid and the wind forcing.

\subsubsection{Case Name}

First, you need to decide on a name for your particular application or
configuration. This name is provided via the \code{ROMS\_APPLICATION} in
either the makefile or the build script. This name should be reasonably
short, all uppercase, with spaces converted to underscores. For example,
let's say we pick the name \code{WIKI\_TEST}. This name gets defined
during the build, so you can add code protected by \code{\#ifdef
WIKI\_TEST} as needed. This would be a good time to either copy the
makefile or the build Script to create one specific to this case prior
to editing it.

\subsubsection{ Case-specific Include File}

Each application has its own include file, included by
\code{cppdefs.h}. The name of this file is the name of your
application (\code{WIKI\_TEST} here) turned into lower case, with '.h'
appended (\code{wiki\_test.h}). The location of this file is set by
\code{MY\_HEADER\_DIR}, pointing to \code{User/Include} or some other
location of your choosing.

The complete list of options to be set prior to compilation are listed in
\S\ref{Cpp1}. Place those you need in the \code{wiki\_test.h} file. These
include algorithm choices (e.g. advection and turbulence closure schemes),
boundary conditions, output options (averages, diagnostics, stations,
floats), and application modules (biology, sediments). Each line should
be of the form:
\begin{verbatim}
        #define SOME_VAR
\end{verbatim}
Note that any undefined variable need not be mentioned.

Also note that if you copy a predefined application from
\code{ROMS/Include} as a template for your application, you must
rename it. If you don't change the name, ROMS will use the one in
\code{ROMS/Include} and your file will be ignored during the build
procedure.

\subsubsection{Functionals}

Some of the cpp Options have names beginning with \code{ANA\_}. For each one of
these, you will be expected to provide an analytic expression for the field
in question in the corresponding include file. These files
are listed in \S\ref{Funcs} and their location is determined
by \code{MY\_ANALYTICAL\_DIR}. You may chose to copy those from
\code{User/Functionals} to some new directory and place your version of
the assignments within
\begin{verbatim}
        #ifdef WIKI_TEST
	! Set weird and wonderful winds
	   :
	#endif
\end{verbatim}
This makes
it easy to search for later, if nothing else.

\subsubsection{\code{checkdefs.F}}

For each new \code{cpp} variable, it is recommended that you also
add the appropriate code to \code{checkdefs.F}, such as:
\begin{verbatim}
       #ifdef SLEET
             IF (Master) WRITE(stdout,20) 'SLEET',                      &
            &   'Sleet falling on the ice option.'
             is=lenstr(Coptions)+1
             Coptions(is:is+7)=' SLEET,'
       #endif /* ICE */
\end{verbatim}
Note that the number ``7'' on the \code{Coptions} line must be set
according to the length of the string you are adding.  In this case 7
is for `` SLEET,'', including the comma and the space.

\subsubsection{Model domain}
\label{Muddy}
One of the first things the user must decide is how many grid points
to use, and can be afforded.  There are three parameters in
\code{ocean.in} which specify the grid size and one parameter for the
number of tracers:
\begin{tabbing}
  Gnu \= Allolo \= \kill
  \> \code{Lm} \> Number of finite-difference points in $\xi$. \\
  \> \code{Mm} \> Number of finite-difference points in $\eta$. \\
  \> \code{N} \> Number of finite-difference points in the vertical. \\
  \> \code{NAT} \> Number of active tracers. \\
  \> \code{NPT} \> Number of passive tracers. \\
  \> \code{NCS} \> Number of cohesive (mud) sediment tracers. \\
  \> \code{NNS} \> Number of non-cohesive (sand) sediment tracers.
\end{tabbing}
The number of biological tracers is set in the \code{biology.in} file.
There are no constraints on these except $\code{Lm} \geq 2$, $\code{Mm}
\geq 2$, $\code{N} \geq 2$ and $\code{NAT} \geq 1$.  \code{Lm} and
\code{Mm} should be at least 3 if the domain is periodic in that
direction.

\subsubsection{$x,y$ grid}
The subroutine \code{get\_grid} or \code{ana\_grid} is called by
\code{initial} to set the grid arrays, the bathymetry, and the
Coriolis parameter.  Most of the simple test problems have their grid
information specified in \code{ana\_grid.h} in the directory
\code{ROMS/Functionals}.  More realistic problems require a NetCDF grid
file, produced by the grid generation programs described in Wilkin and
Hedstrom \cite{GRIDS}.  The variables which are read by
\code{get\_grid} are:
\begin{tabbing}
  Gnu \= \kill
  \> \code{xl, el, spherical, f, h, pm, pn, x\_rho, y\_rho,
  lon\_rho, lat\_rho, angle}.
\end{tabbing}
If the grid is curved, \code{get\_grid} will also read:
\begin{tabbing}
  Gnu \= \kill
  \> \code{dndx, dmde}.
\end{tabbing}

\subsubsection {$\xi,\eta$ grid}
Before providing initial conditions and boundary conditions, the
user must understand the model grid. The fields are laid out on an
Arakawa C grid as in Fig.\ \ref{fcgr}. The overall grid is shown in
Fig.\ \ref{fwgr}.  The thick outer line shows the position of the
model boundary. The points inside this boundary are those which are
advanced in time using the model physics. The points on the boundary
and those on the outside must be supplied by the boundary
conditions.

\label{fwgr}
\end{figure}

The three-dimensional model fields are carried in four-dimensional
arrays, where the fourth array index refers to one of three
time levels. The tracers have a fifth array index tells which
tracer is being referred to.
For instance, $\code{itemp}=1$ refers to
potential temperature while $\code{isalt}=2$ refers to salinity.  The
integers $i$, $j$, and $k$ are used throughout the model to index
the three spatial dimensions:
\begin{tabbing}
Gnus \= Gnus \= \kill
   \>$i$ \>Index variable for the $\xi$-direction. \\
   \>$j$ \>Index variable for the $\eta$-direction. \\
   \>$k$ \>Index variable for the $\sigma$-direction.  $k = 1$
   refers to the bottom \\
biggnu \= \kill
   \>while $k = \code{N}$ refers to the surface.
\end{tabbing}

%The range of $\xi$ is 1 to \code{L} and the range of $\eta$ is 1 to
%\code{M}.  Therefore $i$ and $\xi$ are the same at $\psi$
%points, as are $j$ and $\eta$.  (This matters in the floats---Dale and
%I disagreed on how this should be and then Dale later changed to my
%point of view after I had recoded things to match his).

\subsubsection{Initial conditions}
The initial values for the model fields are provided by either
\code{ana\_initial} or \code{get\_state}.  \code{get\_state} is
also used to read a restart file if the model is being restarted from a
previous run.

Also in \code{initial}, \code{rho\_eos} is called to initialize
the density field. \code{rho\_eos} also computes \code{rhoA},
the vertically averaged density, and \code{rhoS}, the density
perturbation. Both \code{rhoA} and \code{rhoS} are used in the barotropic
pressure gradient.

%The tracer climatology fields also require appropriate values if they
%are to be used, and are provided by \code{ana\_tclima} or
%\code{get\_tclima}. Likewise, the surface height climatology is read by
%\code{get\_ssh} or provided by \code{ana\_ssh}.

\subsubsection{Equation of state}
The equation of state is defined in the subroutine \code{rho\_eos}.  Two
versions are provided in ROMS: a nonlinear $\rho =
\rho(T,S,z)$ from Jackett and McDougall \cite{Jackett} and a linear
$\rho(T,S)$.  The linear form is
$$
      \rho = \code{R0} - \code{Tcoef} \cdot (T-T0) +
      \code{Scoef} \cdot (S-S0)
$$
or
$$
     \rho = \code{R0} + \code{Tcoef} \cdot (T-T0),
$$
depending on whether or not
\code{SALINITY} is defined.  Specify which equation of state you
would like to use with the \code{NONLIN\_EOS} C preprocessor flag your
application include file. The linear coefficients \code{R0}, \code{T0},
\code{Tcoef}, \code{S0}, and \code{Scoef} are set in \code{ocean.in}. Note
that we are computing {\em in situ} density from potential temperature and
salinity. Some of the vertical mixing schemes require potential density
and some other terms, which are computed by \code{rho\_eos} as well.

\subsubsection{Boundary conditions}
\label{Bcs}
The horizontal boundary conditions are provided by the subroutines
in \code{u3dbc\_im}, \code{v3dbc\_im}, \code{u2dbc\_im}, \code{v2dbc\_im},
\code{t3dbc\_im}, and \code{zetabc}.  They are called every timestep
and provide the boundary values for the fields $u, v, \overline{u},
\overline{v}$, all tracers, and $\zeta$, respectively. They are currently
configured for a closed basin, a periodic channel, a doubly periodic
domain or an open domain with various radiation conditions. Each side is
controlled independently with \code{WEST} being the \code{i=1} boundary,
\code{EAST} being the \code{i=L} boundary, \code{SOUTH} being the \code{j=1}
boundary, and \code{NORTH} being the \code{j=M} boundary. These choices are
made via the \code{cpp} options in your include file.

\subsubsection{Model forcing}
\label{Mforce}
\noindent {\bf(a) Winds and thermal fluxes}

There are two different ways to apply a wind forcing: as a surface
momentum flux in the vertical viscosity term, or as a body force over
the upper water column.  In the past, our vertical resolution was
relatively coarse and the vertical viscosity would have to have been
unreasonably large for us to resolve the surface Ekman layer.  If that
is your situation, define \code{BODYFORCE} in \code{cppdefs.h} and
provide a value for \code{levsfrc} in \code{scrum.in}.  The forcing is
applied over the levels from \code{levsfrc} to \code{N}.  The above
caution about vertical resolution also applies to the surface fluxes of
$T$ and $S$, although \code{BODYFORCE} only refers to wind stress, not
the surface tracer fluxes.
%In addition, if you have vertical diffusion
%of tracers and no surface fluxes, you will erode the vertical
%stratification unless \code{CLIMAT\_TS\_MIXV} is defined.

More recently, we have been setting the vertical $s$-coordinate
parameters to retain some resolution near the surface and to apply the
fluxes as boundary conditions to the vertical viscosity/diffusivity.
In either case, the surface and bottom fluxes are either defined
analytically or read from the forcing file.  You must either edit the
appropriate parts of \code{analytical.F} or create a NetCDF forcing
file in the format expected by \code{get\_smflux}, \code{get\_stflux}
and their friends.  Note that it is quite common to put the wind
stress into the forcing file while having an analytic bottom stress.

\smallskip
\noindent {\bf(b) Climatology}

One way to force the model is via a nudging to the tracer climatologies.
This was is used in the North Atlantic simulations in sponge layers
along the northern and southern boundaries.  Set the climatologies
in \code{ana\_tclima} or in a file read by \code{get\_tclima}, set
\code{NUDGING} in \code{cppdefs.h} and also
set the array \code{nudgcof} in \code{set\_nudgcof.F}.


\subsubsection{\code{scrum.in}}
SCRUM expects to read a number of variables on standard in.  It is
easiest to prepare an input file and then run SCRUM as:
\begin{verbatim}
       scrum < scrum.in > scrum.out &
\end{verbatim}
The input is organized as pairs of lines, the first with a number and
then some text which is ignored, the second with the values for the
set of variables for which the first line provides the key.  The pairs
of lines can be in any order but are usually sorted numerically.  The
number 99 signals the end of these pairs and the rest of the input file
contains comments for the user.  The input pairs are as follows:
\begin{klist}
   \kitem{\qquad 1} Time-stepping parameters.
     \begin{klist}
       \kitem{ntimes}    Number of timesteps to evolve the 3-D
       equations in the current run.  This is actually the total
     number, including any previous segments of the same run.  For
     instance, if you already did a three-month run and wish to
     continue for another three months, set \code{ntimes} to the
     number of steps needed for six months.  If you don't like this
     and would prefer to have the behavior of the SPEM variable
     \code{ntmes}, modify \code{main.F} so that:
     \begin{verbatim}
        do iic=ntstart,ntimes
     \end{verbatim}
     becomes
     \begin{verbatim}
        do iic=ntstart,ntimes-1+ntstart
     \end{verbatim}
       \kitem{dt}        Timestep in seconds for the 3-D equations.
       \kitem{ndtfast}   Number of timesteps for the 2-D equations
     to be executed each \code{dt}.
     \end{klist}
   \kitem{\qquad 2}   Input/Output parameters.  SCRUM has several
   possible output files.  The output files
   include a restart file, a history file, an averages file, and a
   station file.  The restart file often contains only two records with
   the older record being overwritten during the next write.  The
   history file can contain a subset of the restart fields, for
   instance just the surface elevation and the surface temperature.
   The averages file contains time-averages of the model fields, for
   instance montly means, or yearly means, depending on \code{navg}.
   The station file contains timeseries for specified points, possibly
   quite frequently since each record is small.
     \begin{klist}
       \kitem{nrrec}     Record number of the restart file to read
     as the initial conditions.
       \kitem{nrreci}    Record number of the ice restart file to read
     as the initial conditions (coupled ice model only).
       \kitem{nrst}      Number of timesteps between writing of
     restart fields.
       \kitem{nwrt}      Number of timesteps between writing fields
     into the history file.
       \kitem{ntsavg}    Starting timestep for the accumulation of
     output time-averaged data.  For instance, you might want to average
     over the last day of a thirty-day run.
       \kitem{navg}      Number of timesteps between writing
     time-averaged data into the averages file.
       \kitem{nsta}      Number of timesteps between writing data into
     stations file.
       \kitem{ninfo}     Number of timesteps between printing a single
     line of diagnostic information to the standard output.
       \kitem{ldefhis}   Logical switch used to create the history
     file.  If \code{.true.}, a new history file is created.  If
     \code{.false.} and $\code{nlev} > 0$, data is appended to an
     existing history file.
       \kitem{lcycle}    Logical flag used to recycle time records in
     the restart file. If \code{.true.}, only the latest two restart
     time records are retained.  If \code{.false.}, all restart
     fields are saved every \code{nrst} timesteps without recycling.
     \end{klist}
   \kitem{\qquad 3}   Laplacian horizontal mixing of tracers.
     \begin{klist}
       \kitem{tnu2}     Constant mixing
     coefficient for the horizontal Laplacian diffusion of each tracer.
     A value is expected for each of the \code{NT} tracers.
     \end{klist}
   \kitem{\qquad 4}   Biharmonic horizontal mixing of tracers.
     \begin{klist}
       \kitem{tnu4}     Constant mixing
     coefficient for the horizontal biharmonic diffusion of each tracer.
     A value is expected for each of the \code{NT} tracers.
     \end{klist}
   \kitem{\qquad 5}   Isopycnal thicknesses.
     \begin{klist}
       \kitem{Kdiff} Isopycnal mixing thickness diffusivity for
     each tracer variable. A value is expected for each of the
     \code{NT} tracers. These isopycnal thicknesses are used when the
     Gent/McWilliams isopycnic mixing is activated (not currently
     implimented).
     \end{klist}
   \kitem{\qquad 6}   Horizontal viscosity coefficients.
     \begin{klist}
       \kitem{uvnu2}    Constant mixing coefficient for the horizontal
     Laplacian viscosity.
       \kitem{uvnu4}    Constant mixing coefficient for the horizontal
     biharmonic viscosity.
     \end{klist}
   \kitem{\qquad 7}   Vertical mixing coefficients for tracers.
     \begin{klist}
       \kitem{akt\_bak}  Background vertical mixing coefficient
     for the tracers.
     A value is expected for each of the \code{NT} tracers.
     \end{klist}
   \kitem{\qquad 8}   Vertical mixing coefficient for momentum.
     \begin{klist}
       \kitem{akv\_bak}  Background vertical mixing coefficient 
     for momentum.
     \end{klist}
   \kitem{\qquad 9}   Mellor-Yamada Level 2.5 parameters.
     \begin{klist}
       \kitem{akq\_bak}  Background vertical mixing coefficient
     for turbulent kinetic energy.
       \kitem{q2nu2}    Constant mixing coefficient for the horizontal
     Laplacian diffusion of turbulent kinetic energy.
       \kitem{q2nu4}    Constant mixing coefficient for the horizontal
     biharmonic diffusion of turbulent kinetic energy.
     \end{klist}
   \kitem{\qquad 10}   Bottom drag coefficients.
     \begin{klist}
       \kitem{rdrg}     Linear bottom drag coefficient.

     recommended to suppress the diffusive nature of the ``upwind''
     scheme.  A value of $\code{adv\_ord}=1$
     will yield the standard ``upwind'' advection.

     stresses as a body force.
            Used when the C-preprocessor option BODYFORCE is defined.

       {\bf WARNING}: Users need to experiment with these parameters. We
                     have found out that the model goes unstable with
                     high values of \code{theta\_s}.  With steep and
                     very tall topography, it is recommended that you

\subsubsection{User variables and subroutines}
\label{Store}
It is possible for the user to add new variables and common blocks
appropriate to a given application.  It is also possible to add
new subroutines, for instance to read in river inflow data.  If
you create new source files they will have to be added to the
\code{Makefile} or the \code{Imakefile} (see \S\ref{Imake}).  Also,
any new \code{\#include} statements will have to
be listed in the \code{Makefile} dependencies.  The simplest way
to add them is to run \code{make depend}.

\subsection{Upwelling/Downwelling Example}
\label{UpDown}
One application for which SCRUM has been configured is a wind-driven
upwelling and downwelling example, described in Macks and Middleton
\cite{Macks93}.  There is a shelf on each wall of a periodic channel
and an along-channel wind forcing, which drives upwelling at one wall
and downwelling at the other.  This problem depends on the Ekman layer,
so a surface stress is used with vertical viscosity.  The Ekman depth
is estimated to be 9 $m$ if $A_v = 0.01 m^2 / s$, so the vertical grid
spacing must resolve this.  The maximum depth is 150 $m$ and our choice
of the vertical grid parameters leads to a surface $\Delta z$ of 4.0
$m$.

\subsubsection{\code{cppdefs.h}}
The C preprocessor variable \code{UPWELLING} has been introduced to
make sure that we can \code{\#define UPWELLING} and have a consistent
upwelling configuration of the model.  This is done in part
within \code{cppdefs.h} by
\begin{verbatim}
        #ifdef UPWELLING
        #define UV_ADV
        #undef  UV_VIS2 
        #define UV_PRS
        #define UV_COR
        #define TS_ADV
        #undef  TS_DIF2
        #undef        NONLIN_EOS
        #undef        SALINITY
        #undef        CURVGRID
        #define       EW_PERIODIC
        #undef        NS_PERIODIC
        #define TIME_AVG
        #undef  BODYFORCE
        #define ANA_GRID
        #define ANA_INITIAL
        #define ANA_MEANRHO
        #define ANA_SMFLUX
        #define ANA_STFLUX
        #define ANA_SSFLUX
        #define ANA_BTFLUX
        #define ANA_BSFLUX
        #define ANA_VMIX
        #endif  /* UPWELLING */
\end{verbatim}
Here we have declared that we want a periodic channel but no masking.
There is neither salinity nor climatology.  The momentum equations have
the Coriolis and pressure gradients, but no horizontal viscosity.  The
only term in the tracer equation is the advection.

\subsubsection{Model domain}
The flow does not vary in $x$, so \code{L} can be small.
Set the values for \code{L}, \code{M}, \code{N} and \code{NT} in
\code{param.h}:
\begin{tabbing}
  Gnus Armadillos Pelicans \= \kill
  \> \code{L} = 42 \\
  \> \code{M} = 81 \\
  \> \code{N} = 16 \\
  \> \code{NT} = 2.
\end{tabbing}

\subsubsection{\code{ana\_grid}}
For this geometry one has a choice of using the grid-generation
programs described in Wilkin and Hedstrom \cite{GRIDS}, or of
using \code{ana\_grid} to create the grid analytically.
The \code{ana\_grid} subroutine in \code{analytical.F} was
modified to produce a bathymetry with a shelf on both walls of the
channel when \code{UPWELLING} is defined.  The fluid depth ranges from
27 $m$ on the shelves to 150 $m$ in the center of the channel.
The horizontal grid spacing is uniform at 1 $km$ and the
Coriolis parameter $f$ is set to a constant value suitable for
Sydney, Australia.

\subsubsection{Initial conditions and the equation of state}
We would like the initial conditions to be a motionless fluid with an
exponential stratification.  \code{ana\_initial} is configured
accordingly.

The stratification can be provided by either $T$ or $S$, or by both
$T$ and $S$.  For
simplicity we will only have an active temperature field and we will
use the linear equation of state by setting \code{NONLIN\_EOS} to
\code{\#undef} in \code{rhsdefs.h}.  We want the density to be 26.35 at
the bottom and 24.22 at the top with an e-folding scale of 50 meters.
The initial temperature is set to $14 + 8\mbox{e}^{z/50}$ in
\code{ana\_initial}.  The linear equation of state parameters are set
in \code{scrum.in}.

Since density does not depend on salinity, we have a choice of how to
handle the second tracer.  We can either use it as a passive tracer or
not timestep on it at all by setting $\code{NT}=1$.  We will use
it as a passive tracer and initialize it to be a
function of $y$.

We have set \code{ana\_meanRHO} to the desired initial density field.
The climatology fields are not used and need not be initialized.

\subsubsection{Boundary conditions}
The periodic channel options have already been chosen in
\code{cppdefs.h}.  We do not have to do anything else.

\subsubsection{Model forcing}
In this problem we want to resolve the
surface Ekman layer and to use a surface wind stress rather than a body
force.  We want the amplitude of the wind to ramp up with time so we
modify \code{ana\_smflux} accordingly.
The wind will build to an amplitude of 0.1 Pascals / $\rho_o$,
or $10^{-4} m^2 s^{-2}$.

We need to edit \code{ana\_vmix} to make sure that the
vertical viscosity \code{Akv} is set to the value we want.  This
must be large at the surface ($10^{-2} m^2 s^{-1}$) to create a thick
Ekman layer, but has been chosen to decrease with depth.  We also need
to check that \code{ana\_sbflux}, \code{ana\_stflux}, etc.\ are
set correctly.

\subsubsection{scrum.in}
The model has been set up to run for one day with an internal timestep
of 120 $s$ and an external timestep of 12 $s$.  We will write history
and restart records every 1/4 day.  The value of the linear bottom
friction coefficient \code{rdrg} is set to $4.5 \times 10^{-4}$ and the
channel walls are set to be free-slip.

\subsubsection{Output}
The model writes some information to standard out, after setting
\code{ninfo} to 72:
\begin{verbatim}

       720  ntimes      Number of timesteps to evolve 3-D equations.

NetCDF history and restart files are also created, containing
the model fields at the requested times.  We have asked it to save both
history and restart records every 1/4 day.  In this case, the restart
file has been told to ``cycle'', or to write over the second last
record.  The restart file at the end of the run contains the fields at
3/4 day and 1 day.  The history file contains records for 0, 1/4, 1/2,
3/4, and 1 day.  Plots can be made from either file, using the plotting
software described in \S\ref{Plothist}.  Selected frames from
such plots are shown in Fig.\ \ref{fsm1} to \ref{fsm2}.

\subsection{Northeast Pacific example}
\label{NEP}
The upwelling/downwelling examples is one in which all the start-up
fields are defined analytically.  The other extreme is one in which
everything is read from files, as in our North Atlantic simulations.

\subsubsection{\code{cppdefs.h}}
The C preprocessor variable \code{DAMEE\_B} has been introduced to
make sure that we can \code{\#define DAMEE\_B} and have a
consistent configuration of the model.  This is done in part within
\code{cppdefs.h} by

Here, we have declared that we want a closed basin (not periodic),
masking, salinity, and the non-linear equation of state.  We want
Laplacian viscosity and diffusion along constant $z$-surfaces and the
full non-linear, curvilinear momentum equations.

We also added the DAMEE flags to \code{checkdefs.F}:
\begin{verbatim}
      #ifdef DAMEE_B
            write(stdout,20) 'DAMEE_B',
           &                 'North Atlantic DAMEE Big Domain Application.'
            is=lenstr(Coptions)+1
            Coptions(is:is+9)=' DAMEE_B,'
            iexample=iexample+1
      #endif /* DAMEE_B */
      #ifdef DAMEE_S
            write(stdout,20) 'DAMEE_S',
           &                 'North Atlantic DAMEE Small Domain Application.'
            is=lenstr(Coptions)+1
            Coptions(is:is+9)=' DAMEE_S,'
            iexample=iexample+1
      #endif /* DAMEE_S */
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Model domain}
A large number of horizontal grid points was chosen to resolve the
domain at less than one degree.  Values for \code{L}, \code{M},
\code{N}, and \code{NT} are:
\begin{tabbing}
  Gnus Armadillos Pelicans \= \kill
  \> \code{L} = 129 \\
  \> \code{M} = 129 \\
  \> \code{N} = 20 \\
  \> \code{NT} = 2.
\end{tabbing}

\subsubsection{\code{gridpak}}
The grid has uniform spacing on a Mercator projection so that both
$\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$ get smaller as you get farther from the
equator.  The grid was chosen to go from 30$^\circ$ S to 65$^\circ$ N
and was generated with \code{sqgrid}.  We then found the latitude and
longitude values with \code{tolat} and interpolated the \code{etopo5}
bathymetry to the grid with \code{bathtub}.  The grid is shown in
Fig.\ \ref{fdg} and the unsmoothed bathymetry is shown in Fig.\
\ref{fdb1}.  It is clear that the unsmoothed bathymetry contains some
incredibly steep regions.  We have not pushed SCRUM to see what its
steepness limit is, but we also ran SPEM in this configuration and its
elliptic solver requires substantial smoothing at this resolution.
We were advised by Bernard Barnier to retain the shallow island
arc in the Caribbean.  We also had some bad experiences with shelves
that disappeared into the land mask, such as at Cape Hatteras and
the Iberian peninsula.  We filled in the Pacific and the Mediterranean
and did some unspeakable hacking to \code{bathsuds} to obtain the
bathymetry shown in Fig.\ \ref{fdb2}.  We then ran \code{sphere} to
obtain the values of $m$ and $n$ suitable for a spherical Earth and ran
Hernan Arango's mask editing tool \code{scrum\_mask}.

\subsubsection{Initial conditions}
We would like the initial conditions to be a motionless fluid with
temperature and salinity fields from the Levitus 1994 February mean
climatology.  We prepared a NetCDF file with zero $u$, $v$ and $\zeta$
fields.  The $T$ and $S$ fields were interpolated from the Levitus
fields---we tried several different interpolation/extrapolation
techniques, including the \code{oa} program described in \S\ref{OA}.

An analytic function for the mean density was added to
\code{ana\_meanRHO} for this problem:
\begin{verbatim}
# elif defined DAMEE_B || defined DAMEE_S
         do k=1,N
           do j=0,M
             do i=0,L
               rhobar(i,j,k)=30.5-0.004*z_r(i,j,k)-
        &                         c4*exp(z_r(i,j,k)/2000.0)
             enddo
           enddo
         enddo
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Boundary conditions}
The non-periodic option has already been chosen by not defining
\code{EW\_PERIODIC} or \code{NS\_PERIODIC} in \code{cppdefs.h}.
After trying a number of options, we ended up with walls to the north
and south with nudging regions (see below).

\subsubsection{Forcing}
The forcing is provided by surface momentum, heat and salt fluxes from
the COADS dataset.  We apply the heat flux correction
(\code{\#define} \code{QCORRECTION}), which is also provided in COADS.
We use the \code{oa} program to put the values onto the model grid for
each of the twelve monthly means.

\subsubsection{Climatology}
We used the same Levitus temperature and salinity fields for the
climatology as for the initial conditions.  The DAMEE problem was
specified to have nudging to the climatology at the northern and
southern boundaries, as well as at the Straits of Gibraltar.  We
edited \code{set\_nudgcof.F} to set the \code{nudgcof} array
accordingly.

\subsubsection{scrum.in}
We use an internal timestep of 2160 $s$ and an external timestep of 108
$s$.  The horizontal viscosity and diffusion is turned off (see above)
since the third-order upwind scheme is providing the smoothing.
The stretching parameters are $\theta = 5$, $b = .4$ and $h_c = 200 m$.

\subsubsection{Output}
The model writes out information to standard out:
\begin{verbatim}
