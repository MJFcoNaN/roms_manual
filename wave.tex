\section{Configuring ROMS for a Specific Application}
\label{Wave}
This chapter describes the parts of ROMS for which the user is
responsible when configuring it for a given application.  Section
\ref{User} describes the process in a generic fashion while
\S\ref{UpDown} and \S\ref{ARCTIC} step through the application of ROMS
to upwelling/downwelling and wind-driven Arctic problems,
respectively.  As distributed, ROMS is ready to run quite a few
examples, where the C preprocessor flags determine which is to be
executed.  Some of these examples are described in
\citet{Haidvogel99}, some are listed here:
\begin{klist}
   \kitem{BASIN} This is a rectangular, flat-bottomed basin with
 double-gyre wind forcing. When run, it produces a western boundary
 current flowing into a central ``Gulf Stream''
 which goes unstable and generates eddies. The goal is to run
 adiabatically to study the homogenization of potential vorticity.
 It earned its nickname of Big Bad Basin by taking a long time to
 run and causing difficulties for the spectral versions of SPEM.
%   \kitem{CANYON\_A} The canyon is a periodic channel with a steep shelf
% along one wall, where the shelf contains a steep canyon.  There is a
% periodic forcing which causes the water to oscillate along the
% channel.  The rotation and the shelf lead to non-zero mean flows,
% especially near the canyon.  Version A is homogeneous and can be
% executed with a 2-D model.  See \citet{HB97} for
% a description of the canyon problems and the gravitational adjustment
% problem.
%   \kitem{CANYON\_B} This is like Canyon A, except that it is
% stratified.
%   \kitem{DAMEE\_4}  DAMEE stands for Data Assimilation and Model
% Evaluation Experiment and is a comparison of different models of
% the North Atlantic.  Version 4 is a big domain
% extending from 30$^\circ$ S to 65$^\circ$ N.  Additional input files
% are required to run the DAMEE configurations.
   \kitem{GRAV\_ADJ} The gravitational adjustment problem takes place
 in a long narrow domain which is initialized with dense water at one
 end and light water at the other. At time zero, the water is released
 and it generates two propagating fronts as the light water rushes to
 fill the top and the dense water rushes to fill the bottom. This
 configuration can be used to test various advection schemes.
   \kitem{OVERFLOW}   This configuration is similar to the
 GRAV\_ADJ problem, but is initialized with dense water in the shallow
part of a domain with a sloping bottom.
   \kitem{SEAMOUNT}   The seamount test has been used to test the pressure
 gradient errors.  It has an idealized seamount in a periodic channel.
 See \citet{BH93} and \citet{McCalpin94} for more information.
   \kitem{UPWELLING}  The upwelling/downwelling example was
 contributed by \citet{Macks93}
 and consists of a periodic channel with shelves on each side.
 There is along-channel wind forcing and the Coriolis term leads
 to upwelling on one side and downwelling on the other side. If
 you run it for several days without vertical mixing, you end up with
 dense water over light water.
\end{klist}
Some NetCDF input files for the ROMS examples can be found under
\code{Data/ROMS} in the ROMS distribution. The ASCII input files are
under \code{ROMS/External}.

\subsection{Configuring ROMS}
\label{User}

The four main sections you need to change in ROMS are the \code{makefile}
or \code{build.bash}, an include file with \code{cpp} options, any
analytic functions, and the ASCII input file. If more realistic fields
are desired, you will have to provide other input files as well, for
instance for the grid and the wind forcing.

\subsubsection{Case Name}

First, you need to decide on a name for your particular application or
configuration. This name is provided via the \code{ROMS\_APPLICATION} in
either the makefile or the build script. This name should be reasonably
short, all uppercase, with spaces converted to underscores. For example,
let's say we pick the name \code{WIKI\_TEST}. This name gets defined
during the build, so you can add code protected by \code{\#ifdef
WIKI\_TEST} as needed. This would be a good time to either copy the
makefile or the build Script to create one specific to this case prior
to editing it.

\subsubsection{ Case-specific Include File}

Each application has its own include file, included by
\code{cppdefs.h}. The name of this file is the name of your
application (\code{WIKI\_TEST} here) turned into lower case, with '.h'
appended (\code{wiki\_test.h}). The location of this file is set by
\code{MY\_HEADER\_DIR}, pointing to \code{User/Include} or some other
location of your choosing.

The complete list of options to be set prior to compilation are listed in
\S\ref{Cpp1}. Place those you need in the \code{wiki\_test.h} file. These
include algorithm choices (e.g. advection and turbulence closure schemes),
output options (averages, diagnostics, stations, floats), and
application modules (biology, sediments). Each line should be of the
form:
\begin{verbatim}
        #define SOME_VAR
\end{verbatim}
Note that any undefined variable need not be mentioned.

Also note that if you copy a predefined application from
\code{ROMS/Include} as a template for your application, you must
rename it. If you don't change the name, ROMS will use the one in
\code{ROMS/Include} and your file will be ignored during the build
procedure.

\subsubsection{Functionals}

Some of the cpp options have names beginning with \code{ANA\_}. For each one of
these, you will be expected to provide an analytic expression for the field
in question in the corresponding include file. These files
are listed in \S\ref{Functionals} and their location is determined
by \code{MY\_ANALYTICAL\_DIR}. You may chose to copy those from
\code{User/Functionals} to some new directory and place your version of
the assignments within
\begin{verbatim}
        #ifdef WIKI_TEST
        ! Set weird and wonderful winds
           :
        #endif
\end{verbatim}
This makes
it easy to search for later, if nothing else.

\subsubsection{\code{checkdefs.F}}

For each new \code{cpp} variable other than your application name,
it is recommended that you also
add the appropriate code to \code{checkdefs.F}, such as:
\begin{verbatim}
       #ifdef SLEET
             IF (Master) WRITE(stdout,20) 'SLEET',                      &
            &   'Sleet falling on the ice option.'
             is=lenstr(Coptions)+1
             Coptions(is:is+7)=' SLEET,'
       #endif /* SLEET */
\end{verbatim}
Note that the number ``7'' on the \code{Coptions} line must be set
according to the length of the string you are adding.  In this case 7
is for `` SLEET,'', including the comma and the space. Again, you do not
need to do this for your application name (\code{WIKI\_TEST} here),
since \code{checkdefs} will print whatever is in \code{MyAppCPP}.

\subsubsection{Model domain}
\label{Muddy}
It is assumed in this manual that \code{Ngrids} will be set to 1.
Having multiple grids talk to each other is brand new in ROMS 3.7,
with documentation appearing on the ROMS wiki (and not currently
supported in the ice model).

One of the first things the user must decide is how many grid points
to use, and can be afforded.  There are three parameters in
\code{ocean.in} which specify the grid size and one parameter for the
number of active tracers:
\begin{tabbing}
  Gnu \= Allolo \= \kill
  \> \code{Lm} \> Number of finite-difference points in $\xi$. \\
  \> \code{Mm} \> Number of finite-difference points in $\eta$. \\
  \> \code{N} \> Number of finite-difference points in the vertical. \\
  \> \code{NAT} \> Number of active tracers. \\
\end{tabbing}
The number of biological tracers is set in the \code{biology.in} file.
There are no constraints on these except $\code{Lm} \geq 2$, $\code{Mm}
\geq 2$, $\code{N} \geq 2$ and $\code{NAT} \geq 1$.  \code{Lm} and
\code{Mm} should be at least 3 if the domain is periodic in that
direction.

\subsubsection{$x,y$ grid}
The subroutine \code{get\_grid} or \code{ana\_grid} is called by
\code{initial} to set the grid arrays, the bathymetry, and the
Coriolis parameter.  Most of the simple test problems have their grid
information specified in \code{ana\_grid.h} in the directory
\code{ROMS/Functionals}.  More realistic problems require a NetCDF grid
file, produced by the grid generation programs described in
\citet{GRIDS}, by the Matlab \code{SeaGrid}, or by some
other method.  The variables which are read by \code{get\_grid} are:
\begin{tabbing}
  Gnu \= \kill
  \> \code{xl, el, spherical, f, h, pm, pn, x\_rho, y\_rho,
  lon\_rho, lat\_rho, angle}.
\end{tabbing}
If the grid is curved, \code{get\_grid} will also read:
\begin{tabbing}
  Gnu \= \kill
  \> \code{dndx, dmde}.
\end{tabbing}
Likewise, if \code{MASKING} is defined, it will read:
\begin{tabbing}
  Gnu \= \kill
  \> \code{mask\_rho, mask\_u, mask\_v, mask\_psi}.
\end{tabbing}

\subsubsection {$\xi,\eta$ grid}
Before providing initial conditions and boundary conditions, the
user must understand the model grid. The fields are laid out on an
Arakawa C grid as in Fig.\ \ref{fcgr}. The overall grid is shown in
Fig.\ \ref{fwgr}.  The thick outer line shows the position of the
model boundary. The points inside this boundary are those which are
advanced in time using the model physics. The points on the boundary
and those on the outside must be supplied by the boundary
conditions.

The three-dimensional model fields are carried in four-dimensional
arrays, where the fourth array index refers to one of two or three
time levels. The tracers have a fifth array index telling which
tracer is being referred to.
For instance, $\code{itemp}=1$ refers to
potential temperature while $\code{isalt}=2$ refers to salinity.  The
integers $i$, $j$, and $k$ are used throughout the model to index
the three spatial dimensions:
\begin{tabbing}
Gnus \= Gnus \= \kill
   \>$i$ \>Index variable for the $\xi$-direction. \\
   \>$j$ \>Index variable for the $\eta$-direction. \\
   \>$k$ \>Index variable for the $\sigma$-direction.  $k = 1$
   refers to the bottom \\
biggnu \= \kill
   \>while $k = \code{N}$ refers to the surface.
\end{tabbing}

%The range of $\xi$ is 1 to \code{L} and the range of $\eta$ is 1 to
%\code{M}.  Therefore $i$ and $\xi$ are the same at $\psi$
%points, as are $j$ and $\eta$.  (This matters in the floats---Dale and
%I disagreed on how this should be and then Dale later changed to my
%point of view after I had recoded things to match his).

\subsubsection{Initial conditions}
The initial values for the model fields are provided by either
\code{ana\_initial} or \code{get\_state}.  \code{get\_state} is
also used to read a restart file if the model is being restarted from a
previous run.

Also in \code{initial}, \code{rho\_eos} is called to initialize
the density field. \code{rho\_eos} also computes \code{rhoA},
the vertically averaged density, and \code{rhoS}, the density
perturbation. Both \code{rhoA} and \code{rhoS} are used in the barotropic
pressure gradient.

%The tracer climatology fields also require appropriate values if they
%are to be used, and are provided by \code{ana\_tclima} or
%\code{get\_tclima}. Likewise, the surface height climatology is read by
%\code{get\_ssh} or provided by \code{ana\_ssh}.

\subsubsection{Equation of state}
The equation of state is defined in the subroutine \code{rho\_eos}.  Two
versions are provided in ROMS: a nonlinear $\rho =
\rho(T,S,z)$ from \citet{Jackett} and a linear
$\rho(T,S)$.  The linear form is
$$
      \rho = \code{R0} - \code{Tcoef} \cdot (T-T0) +
      \code{Scoef} \cdot (S-S0)
$$
or
$$
     \rho = \code{R0} + \code{Tcoef} \cdot (T-T0),
$$
depending on whether or not
\code{SALINITY} is defined.  Specify which equation of state you
would like to use with the \code{NONLIN\_EOS} C preprocessor flag in your
application include file. The linear coefficients \code{R0}, \code{T0},
\code{Tcoef}, \code{S0}, and \code{Scoef} are set in \code{ocean.in}. Note
that we are computing {\em in situ} density from potential temperature and
salinity. Some of the vertical mixing schemes require potential density
and some other fields, which are computed by \code{rho\_eos} as well.

\subsubsection{Boundary conditions}
\label{Bcs}
The horizontal boundary conditions are provided by the subroutines
in \code{u3dbc\_im}, \code{v3dbc\_im}, \code{u2dbc\_im}, \code{v2dbc\_im},
\code{t3dbc\_im}, and \code{zetabc}.  They are called every time-step
and provide the boundary values for the fields $u, v, \overline{u},
\overline{v}$, all tracers, and $\zeta$, respectively. They are currently
configured for a closed basin, a periodic channel, a doubly periodic
domain or a domain with various open boundary conditions. Each side is
controlled independently with ``West'' being the \code{i=1} boundary,
``East'' being the \code{i=L} boundary, ``South'' being the \code{j=1}
boundary, and ``North'' being the \code{j=M} boundary. These choices are
set in \code{ocean.in} via the \code{LBC} array.

Many of the choices for open boundaries require that the model have
some boundary values for the field in question. These can be specified in
the appropriate \code{ana\_xxx.h} file for say \code{ANA\_TOBC} or
they can be read from a boundary NetCDF file. There is logic in
\code{globaldefs.h} by which ROMS decides whether or not it needs to
read a boundary file.

\subsubsection{Model forcing}
\label{Mforce}
\noindent {\bf(a) Winds and thermal fluxes}

There are two different ways to apply a wind forcing: as a surface
momentum flux in the vertical viscosity term, or as a body force over
the upper water column.
Usually, we set the vertical $\sigma$-coordinate
parameters to retain some resolution near the surface and apply the
fluxes as boundary conditions to the vertical viscosity/diffusivity.
In either case, the surface and bottom fluxes are either defined
analytically, read from a forcing file, or computed inside ROMS
using a bulk flux formula from the appropriate atmospheric fields
(air temperature and winds, for instance).  You must either edit the
appropriate \code{ana\_xxx.h} or create a NetCDF forcing
file in the format expected by ROMS. Note that it is quite common
to put the surface variables in the forcing file while having an analytic
bottom heat flux. ROMS now has the capability of reading in a list
of forcing fields---it can be convenient to have one file per field
rather than stuffing tides, winds, river inputs all into one file.

In the past, our vertical resolution was relatively coarse and the
vertical viscosity would have to have been unreasonably large for
us to resolve the surface Ekman layer.  If that is your situation,
define \code{BODYFORCE} in \code{cppdefs.h} and provide a value for
\code{levsfrc} in \code{ocean.in}.  The forcing is applied over the
levels from \code{levsfrc} to \code{N}.  The above caution about
vertical resolution also applies to the surface fluxes of $T$ and
$S$, although \code{BODYFORCE} only refers to wind stress, not the
surface tracer fluxes.

\smallskip
\noindent {\bf(b) Climatology}

One way to force the model is via a nudging to the tracer and/or
momentum climatologies. Nudging to tracers was used in the North
Atlantic simulations in sponge layers along the northern and southern
boundaries. Set the climatologies in \code{ana\_tclima.h} or in a
file read by \code{get\_data}, set \code{TCLM\_NUDGING} in
\code{wiki\_test.h} and also set the array \code{Tnudgcof} in
\code{ana\_nudgcoef.h}.

\smallskip
\noindent {\bf(c) Tides}

There is also more than one way to force with tides. One way is to
provide boundary conditions with enough temporal resolution to
resolve the tides. Another is to provide ROMS with the tidal
constituents at all grid points and to have ROMS reconstruct the
tidal currents (\code{UV\_TIDES})  and/or elevations (\code{SSH\_TIDES})
for any given time. An example of such a tidal forcing file is in
\code{Data/ROMS/Forcing/test\_head\_frc.nc}.

The non-trunk code with ice, etc. includes the \code{TIDES\_ASTRO} option to
add on the long-period tides from
\citet{Foreman_96a} and \citet{Foreman_96b}.
There is also an option to include the tidal potential
forcing term (\code{POT\_TIDES}), requiring the tidal potential to
be included in the tides forcing file.

\smallskip
\noindent {\bf(d) Rivers}

Point sources can be used to provide river inflow to the model.
These too can be specified in a forcing file if not provided via
\code{ana\_psource}.

\subsubsection{\code{ocean.in}}
\label{ASCII_in}
ROMS expects to read a number of variables from an ASCII file as described
in \S\ref{Running}.
Example input files are in \code{ROMS/External} with names like
\code{ocean\_grav\_adj.in}, where ``grav\_adj'' refers to the name of
the application. Lines beginning with ``!'' are comments and will be
ignored by ROMS on reading them.

The input is organized as key/value pairs, separated by one or two
equals signs. It is possible for ROMS to run on more than one grid
simultaneously, with the number of grids being read from the input
file. If there is one equals sign (\code{=}), ROMS will use the
corresponding value for all grids. If there are two (\code{==}), ROMS
will read a value for each grid. Thus far, our domains have used just
one grid since the inter-grid coupling has only been released very
recently.

ROMS will ignore the parameters not needed by the current
simulation, e.g., the GLS parameters will not be read if you are not
using that mixing scheme. However, I believe all the example files
contain all possible parameters (except the ice branch ones).
The input parameters are in groups, as follows:
\begin{klist}
   \kitem{Header} \mbox{}

   \kitem{Input/Output parameters} \mbox{}

   ROMS has several possible output files. The output files can
   include a restart file, a history file, an averages file, and a
   station file, for instance.  The restart file often contains
   only two records with the older record being overwritten during
   the next write.  The history file can contain a subset of the
   restart fields, for instance just the surface elevation and the
   surface temperature.  The averages file contains time-averages
   of the model fields, for instance daily or monthly means,
   depending on \code{NAVG}.  The station file contains timeseries
   for specified points, possibly quite frequently since each record
   is small. For some, machinery is in place to write multiple
   files, numbering them \_0001, \_0002, etc.
     \begin{klist}
       \kitem{NRREC}     Record number of the restart file to read
     as the initial conditions. Set to 0 at the beginning of the
     run, -1 to read the latest record.
       \kitem{LcycleRST} Logical, true to cycle between two records
     of the restart file.
       \kitem{NRST}      Number of time-steps between writing of

       NaN values.

\subsubsection{User variables and subroutines}
\label{Store}
It is possible for the user to add new variables and functionality,
though it is discouraged. The design goal is to isolate the most common
features a user would change to the \code{cpp} switches
(\S\ref{Cpp1}), the \code{ana\_xx.h} files (\S\ref{Functionals}) and
the ASCII input file (\S\ref{ASCII_in}). A query on the ROMS forum
might be in order if you have something specific in mind.

If you do choose to add bits, know that the \code{makefile}
fragments called \code{Module.mk} will attempt to compile and
link into a library anything
with a \code{.F} extension in the directories already generating a
library from such files.

\subsection{Upwelling/Downwelling Example}
\label{UpDown}
The application which ROMS is configured to run as distributed
is a wind-driven
upwelling and downwelling example, described in
\citet{Macks93}.  There is a shelf on each wall of a periodic channel
and an along-channel wind forcing, which drives upwelling at one wall
and downwelling at the other.  This problem depends on the Ekman layer,
therefore a surface stress is used with vertical viscosity.  The Ekman
depth is estimated to be 9 $m$ if $A_v = 0.01 m^2 / s$, so the vertical
grid spacing must resolve this.  The maximum depth is 150 $m$ and our
choice of the vertical grid parameters leads to a surface $\Delta z$
of 4.0 $m$.

\subsubsection{\code{cppdefs.h}}
The C preprocessor variable \code{UPWELLING} is used for the
upwelling configuration of the model. The \code{makefile} will
direct \code{cppdefs.h} to include the file \code{upwelling.h}:

\end{verbatim}
Here we have declared that we want a three-dimensional solution, but
no masking. There is salinity but we're using a linear equation of state.
The momentum equations have advection, Coriolis force and pressure
gradients. There is both horizontal viscosity and diffusion, but they
are along constant $\sigma$-surfaces and if you check the input file,
you find that the horizontal diffusion is set to zero.

There are ifdefs for various biology cases, none of which
have been defined. Likewise, we are using the default of
\code{ANA\_VMIX} as distributed. We are asking for many other
analytic functions too, including the grid. We are asking
for diagnostic output with the \code{DIAGNOSTICS\_TS} and
\code{DIAGNOSTICS\_UV}.

\subsubsection{Model domain}
The flow does not vary in $x$, so \code{Lm} can be almost anything.
Set the values for \code{Lm}, \code{Mm}, \code{N} and \code{NT} in
the input file:
\begin{verbatim}
          Lm == 41            ! Number of I-direction INTERIOR RHO-points
          Mm == 80            ! Number of J-direction INTERIOR RHO-points
           N == 16            ! Number of vertical levels

         NAT =  2             ! Number of active tracers (usually, 2)
\end{verbatim}
A historical note: \code{Lm} here really is 41 for 41 boxes in the
$x$-direction. It was originally set to 41 for 40 boxes, but the
periodic boundary conditions are now more efficient and no longer
need an extra box. One could just as well set it to 40 (or even 5).

\subsubsection{\code{ana\_grid}}
For this geometry one has a choice of using one of the external
grid-generation programs or of using \code{ana\_grid} to create the grid
analytically. The code in \code{ana\_grid.h} was modified to produce a
bathymetry with a shelf on both walls of the channel when \code{UPWELLING}
is defined. The fluid depth ranges from 27 $m$ on the shelves to 150 $m$
in the center of the channel.  The horizontal grid spacing is uniform
at 1 $km$ and the Coriolis parameter $f$ is set to a constant value
suitable for Sydney, Australia.

\subsubsection{Initial conditions and the equation of state}
We would like the initial conditions to be a motionless fluid with an
exponential stratification. The \code{UPWELLING} section of
\code{ana\_initial.h} is configured accordingly.

The stratification can be provided by either $T$ or $S$, or by both
$T$ and $S$.  For
simplicity we will only have an active temperature field and we will
use the linear equation of state by setting \code{NONLIN\_EOS} to
\code{\#undef}. We want the density to be 26.35 at
the bottom and 24.22 at the top with an e-folding scale of 50 meters.
The initial temperature is set to \code{T0}$ + 8\mbox{e}^{z/50}$ in
\code{ana\_initial}.  The linear equation of state parameters are set
in \code{ocean\_upwelling.in}:
\begin{verbatim}
          R0 == 1027.0d0                   ! kg/m3
          T0 == 14.0d0                     ! Celsius
          S0 == 35.0d0                     ! PSU
       TCOEF == 1.7d-4                     ! 1/Celsius
       SCOEF == 0.0d0                      ! 1/PSU
\end{verbatim}

Since density does not depend on salinity, we have a choice of how to
handle the second tracer. The salinity is set to a uniform value
of \code{S0}, though it could be left out entirely if we undefine
\code{SALINITY} and set \code{NAT} to 1.

\subsubsection{Boundary conditions}
In \code{ocean\_upwelling.in}, the variable \code{LBC} is set to be
periodic in the East-West direction, with closed walls to the North
and South. No boundary values are required.

\subsubsection{Model forcing}
In this problem we want to resolve the
surface Ekman layer and to use a surface wind stress rather than a body
force.  We want the amplitude of the wind to ramp up with time so we
modify \code{ana\_smflux.h} accordingly.
The wind will build to an amplitude of 0.1 Pascals / $\rho_o$,
or $10^{-4} m^2 s^{-2}$.

We need to edit \code{ana\_vmix.h} to make sure that the
vertical viscosity \code{Akv} is set to the value we want.  This
must be large at the surface ($10^{-2} m^2 s^{-1}$) to create a thick
Ekman layer, but has been chosen to decrease with depth.  We also need
to check that \code{ana\_sbflux}, \code{ana\_stflux}, etc.\ are
set correctly, in this case taking the default of zero rather than
explicitly setting anything for \code{UPWELLING}. However, we do set
\code{ana\_srflux} to be non-zero in case we opt to turn on one of
the biology models.

\subsubsection{ocean.in}
The model has been set up to run for five days with an internal time-step
of 300 $s$ and an external time-step of 10 $s$.
\begin{verbatim}
      NTIMES == 1440
          DT == 300.0d0

Note that it ends by printing out a profile of where the time was
used---the ratios will vary depending on the application.

NetCDF history and restart files are also created, containing
the model fields at the requested times. We have asked it to save 
restart records every day. In this case, the restart
file has been told to ``cycle'', or to write over the second last
record. The restart file at the end of the run contains the fields at
day 4 and day 5. The history file contains records for 0, 1/4, 1/2,
3/4, and 1 day, etc., while the averages and diagnostics files are
at 1/8, 3/8, 5/8, and 7/8 day, etc..
Plots can be made from any one of these files, using the plotting
software described in
\href{https://www.myroms.org/wiki/index.php/Plotting_Package_Installation}{ROMS
plotting package}. Selected frames from
such plots are shown in Fig.\ \ref{fsm1} to \ref{fsm2}.

\subsection{Arctic example}
\label{ARCTIC}
The upwelling/downwelling examples is one in which all the start-up
fields are defined analytically.  The other extreme is one in which
everything is read from files, as in our Arctic simulations.
Figure \ref{fbath_arc} shows the bathymetry and the extent of this
domain. The grid is non-uniform, having more resolution close to
Alaska - a measure of grid spacing is shown in Figure
\ref{fgspace_arc}.

\subsubsection{\code{arctic.h}}
The C preprocessor variable \code{ARCTIC} has been chosen to
label our Arctic domain, which is a close cousin to \code{NEP6}.
The header include file then becomes \code{arctic.h}:

We've got masking, salinity, sea ice and the non-linear equation of state.
We want Laplacian viscosity on $\sigma$-surfaces, diffusion along constant
$z$-surfaces and the full non-linear, curvilinear momentum equations.

Notice that comments are allowed in this file as long as they are in
the C/C++ syntax. Also, conditionals are fine---some parts are only
wanted when \code{SOLVE3D} is on. There is evidence of options
having been tried and rejected, such as the quadratic bottom drag
in the presence of tides.
Sources are turned on to presribe inflow through Bering Strait
(\code{UV\_PSOURCE}).

\subsubsection{Arctic code chunks}
The \code{Apps/Arctic} directory contains the \code{ana\_}
family of include files for setting the bottom drag, the horizontal
mixing coefficients, and the nudging coefficients.
Doing a search for \code{ARCTIC} shows up a few other bits of code. One
is in \code{output.F}, forcing a new station file after every
restart:
\begin{verbatim}
#ifdef ARCTIC
          CALL def_station (ng, .true.)
#else
          CALL def_station (ng, ldefout(ng))
#endif
\end{verbatim}
A better fix (someday) would be to allow the station files to be
numbered just like the averages files. Why not set \code{ldefout} to
be true? It is shared by many outputs, including the floats, and you
can only restart floats with \code{ldefout} set to false.

There is a hack in \code{grid\_coords.F} so that floats and stations
are placed at the correct $i,j$ position. Otherwise, the code to
find $i,j$ from longitude, latitude finds two boxes with the correct
range, one where I want it, the other at the same latitude, but
where the longitude jumps from 360 back to 0.

There is code in \code{set\_masks.F} to position the mask for
the ice outflow cells off the coast of Greenland.

Finally, there is a kludge in \code{step\_floats.F} for a
float reuse strategy, restarting them each year. Having a handy tag like
\code{ARCTIC} allows me to search for these little hacks later.

\subsubsection{Model domain}
A number of horizontal grid points was chosen to resolve the
domain at roughly 5 km near Alaska, less well across the basin, but
with only twice as many points as the regional Chukchi domain. Values
for \code{Lm}, \code{Mm}, and \code{N} are:
\begin{verbatim}
          Lm == 472           ! Number of I-direction INTERIOR RHO-points
          Mm == 480           ! Number of J-direction INTERIOR RHO-points
           N == 50            ! Number of vertical levels
\end{verbatim}
The vertical structure is set to our new favorite, using the new stretching:
\begin{verbatim}
  Vtransform == 2                          ! transformation equation
 Vstretching == 4                          ! stretching function

     THETA_S == 7.0d0                      ! surface stretching parameter
     THETA_B == 2.0d0                      ! bottom  stretching parameter
      TCLINE == 250.0d0                    ! critical depth (m)
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Initial and boundary conditions}
The best ocean fields we knew of when setting this up are known as SODA, a
reanalysis from 1958 through 2005 by
\citet{Carton_2005}. There are \code{Python} scripts to create
initial and boundary conditions from the SODA files. Snow and ice
initial and boundary conditions are obtained from model results generously
provided by Jinlun Zhang. I am using three boundary files so that each
field can have its own unlimited dimension---there are three frequencies,
from daily to monthly.

The side known as ``South'' is along Northern Alaska and Western
Canada and is set to closed. The side known as ``West'' is only open
at Bering Strait, where I am imposing the inflow using a ``rivers''
file, but letting temperature and salinity come in from SODA
boundary conditions. The last two boundaries on the Atlantic side
have our usual combination of radiation and nudging:
\begin{verbatim}
   LBC(isFsur) ==   Cha     Clo     Cha     Cha         ! free-surface
   LBC(isUbar) ==   Clo     Clo     Fla     Fla         ! 2D U-momentum
   LBC(isVbar) ==   Clo     Clo     Fla     Fla         ! 2D V-momentum
   LBC(isUvel) ==   Clo     Clo     RadNud  RadNud      ! 3D U-momentum
   LBC(isVvel) ==   Clo     Clo     RadNud  RadNud      ! 3D V-momentum
   LBC(isMtke) ==   Gra     Clo     Gra     Gra         ! mixing TKE

   LBC(isTvar) ==   RadNud  Clo     RadNud  RadNud \    ! temperature
                    RadNud  Clo     RadNud  RadNud      ! salinity

! Ice boundary conditions

   LBC(isAice) ==   Mix     Clo     Mix     Mix         ! ice concentration
   LBC(isHice) ==   Mix     Clo     Mix     Mix         ! ice thickness
   LBC(isHsno) ==   Mix     Clo     Mix     Mix         ! snow thickness
   LBC(isTice) ==   Clo     Clo     Clo     Clo         ! ice temperature
   LBC(isSfwat)==   Clo     Clo     Clo     Clo         ! surface water
   LBC(isSig11)==   Clo     Clo     Clo     Clo         ! sigma-11
   LBC(isSig12)==   Clo     Clo     Clo     Clo         ! sigma-12
   LBC(isSig22)==   Clo     Clo     Clo     Clo         ! sigma-22
   LBC(isUice) ==   Gra     Clo     Gra     Gra         ! ice U-momentum
   LBC(isVice) ==   Gra     Clo     Gra     Gra         ! ice V-momentum

\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Forcing}
We are using the CORE2 forcing files \citep{Large_08} and computing the
momentum, heat and salt fluxes from the atmospheric conditions and the
model's surface temperature. There are two options, one provided by
\code{bulk\_flux.F} and the other provided by \code{ccsm\_flux.F}. We
are using the second. With minimal fussing, the CORE2 files
can be used as is, on their native grid, then interpolated by ROMS
internally to the domain at hand. Other forcings include a nudging
to sea surface salinity, runoff from Dai and Trenberth, a fastice
climatology from Andy Mahoney, Bering Strait flow estimated by Seth
Danielson using Rebecca Woodgate's mooring data, and tides from OTPS.

\subsubsection{ocean.in}
We use an internal time-step of 200 $s$ and an external time-step of 10
$s$. The horizontal viscosity and diffusion is:
\begin{verbatim}
        TNU2 == 5.0d0  5.0d0                    ! m2/s
       VISC2 == 25.0d0                          ! m2/s
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Output}
The model writes voluminous information to standard out, as shown
for the \code{UPWELLING} case.  It also writes out NetCDF files for
restart, daily averages, three-hourly averages2, stations and floats.
Plots can be made from any of these files; some examples are shown
in Fig.\ \ref{fnep1}--\ref{fnep2} .
