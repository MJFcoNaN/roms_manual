\section{Plotting Programs for Postprocessing}
\label{Plothist}
Hernan Arango has provided SCRUM with some programs for creating plots
from the NetCDF history and restart files. Some example plots are shown
in \S\ref{Wave}. There are four plotting programs:
\begin{klist}
   \kitem{cnt} creates black-and-white plots of the horizontal fields,
including constant depth plots of the 3-D fields.
   \kitem{ccnt} creates color plots of the horizontal fields,
including constant depth plots of the 3-D fields.
   \kitem{sec} creates black-and-white plots of vertical slices through
the 3-D fields.  It includes on option of finding equal-spaced points
along a straight line through the curvilinear grid.
   \kitem{csec} creates color plots of vertical slices through
the 3-D fields.  It includes on option of finding equal-spaced points
along a straight line through the curvilinear grid.
\end{klist}
All of these program come with example input files.  For instance, the
input file for \code{ccnt} is called \code{ccnt.in} and is as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
1996 -1  :  year and starting year-day (use yearday<0, for no time label)

            4th line: input; primary NetCDF file.
            5th line: input; secondary NetCDF file.
            6th line: input; grid NetCDF file.
            7th line: input; coastlines file.

 *** IREF:  Secondary or reference field option:
           -1   Overlay horizontal grid
            0   no secondary or reference field to plot
            1   plot field overlay from primary file

            3   primary - secondary file (field subtraction)
            4   Day0 - DayN (field subtraction)

 *** IPROJ: Map Projections option.  Some of the values for the
            projection Pole and rotation angle are suggested.
            Check the NCAR manual for details.

           [1] Cylindrical equidistant: PLON=0, PLAT=0, ROTA=0
           [2] Mercator: PLON=?, PLAT=0, ROTA=0
           [3] Lambert conformal conic: PLON=?, PLAT=?, ROTA=?
           [4] Stereographic azimuthal:  PLON=?, PLAT=90 or -90, ROTA=0

 *** IVINC, JVINC: vector grid sampling.  If either value is negative,
                   the velocity vectors at drawn at PSI-points.  Otherwise,
                   if both values are positive, the vectors are drawn at
                   interior RHO-points.

 *** LGRID: Longitude/latitude grid spacing.  The grid is drawn at
            LGRID spacing starting from specified map lower corner.
            If LGRID is negative, the latitude labels in the map are
            rotated 90 degrees to avoid label congestion, if any.

 *** NPAGE: Number of plots per page.  Set this parameter to a negative
            value (-1, -2, or -4) to activate preservation of the plot
            aspect ratio.

As you can see, there are comments describing what needs to be
done.  Please see the variable ID file for the complete list of fields
which can be plotted---this list changes as Hernan adds the ability to
plot new fields. Also, check your default.cnt file for other vector and
contour parameters. The palette file includes two number systems, one
in the scale from 0 to 255 and the other from 0 to 1.
The SCRUM plotting uses the first while the SEOM plotting uses the
second.
